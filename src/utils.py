You are a text structuring expert. Your task is to analyze the raw, unstructured text from a student's answer sheet and map the answers to the correct question numbers.

**Instructions:**
1.  Read the provided "Raw Text from Answer Sheet".
2.  The official question numbers are: {question_numbers}.
3.  Your job is to intelligently associate the text with the correct question number.
4.  Structure your final output as a single, valid JSON object.
5.  If you cannot find an answer for a specific question, the value for that key should be "No answer provided".

**CRITICAL RULE:** You MUST NOT alter, correct, add to, or summarize the student's original text. Your only job is to copy the existing text verbatim into the correct JSON value. The integrity of the student's answer is paramount.

**Example Output Format:**
{{
  "1": "This is the complete answer for question 1...",
  "2": "This is the answer for question 2...",
  "3": "No answer provided"
}}

**Raw Text from Answer Sheet:**
"{raw_text}"

Now, provide the structured JSON object.
